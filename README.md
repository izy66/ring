# Ring

A Sage Math implementation of the trace & report ring signature protocol proposed in https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-92548-2_10 and https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1293.

! Disclaimer: This project is in fullfillment of CO485/685 - Public Key Cryptography at University of Waterloo. No side-channel security nor performance is guaranteed. All source files are made and tested on the Apple Silicon M1 platform, with Sage version 9.6.

To test the correctness of protocol, run

```
load('main.py')
```

in a Sage Math interactive shell.
